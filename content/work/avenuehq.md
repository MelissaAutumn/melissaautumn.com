From 2017 to 2022 I was a Full-Stack Developer working at AvenueHQ. 

I've worked on a wide array of projects such as architecting and building a semi-automated task system to help reduce repetitive and time costly activities. I've also worked on upgrading and reducing technical debt on both front-end and back-end projects.
